# Intern Formation Project - Cinetis

This project will serve as an exercise for new arrivals to learn and apply their knowledge on basic iOS (Swift) development. The main objective is to create a movie collection app by applying everyday concepts of mobile development, such as TableView, CollectionView, MapView, TabBar Controller...

## Data Sources

Initially the data would be hardcoded to make it easy for the interns to develop, but as they grow, the project should receive a refactor in order to get the data either from a predefined JSON file or a public API, letting them learn about Network implementation.

## Dependency Injection

Further in the development, interns should inject at least two dependencies, *one with SPM and one with CocoaPods*, to learn how will work Dependency Injection and how has been working since now on older projects.

Proposals:

[IQKeyboardManager (SPM)](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager)

[Firebase (CocoaPods)](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk)

## Main Objective

This app combines everyday elements from development into one, and should be developed from scratch, allowing interns to learn every aspect of an app creation.

# How to work

Interns should work from their respective develop branch. They should effort in order to manage git as a team, by interacting everyone with the same repository, and some times, even with the same files.

## Merge Request

Any task should be reviewed (and approved) at least twice by the developer asigned to the interns formation and any other intern from the team, ensuring the code still compiles and everything on the task has been completed correctly. Only then, a MR should be considered as valid and merged into corresponding develop branch.

## Researching

Ask for help to the responsable developer is allowed, but interns should effort, at least after the initial phase, on researching by themselves for provided documentation and tutorials online, as it is an essential part of every developer's work day.

# Instructions

This project should be branched from master into a custom develop branch identifying the intern's promotion, and then working from there into respective branches tracking Trello/Jira's tasks.
